## Overview

Spoken Digit Recognition is an **isolated word recognition** system that transcribes individual spoken numbers.

## Dataset

The [Free Spoken Digit Dataset (FSDD)](https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset) was used to train the model which had 1,500 recordings from 3 speakers with english accents.

The model was trained on 1,470 recordings, and tested on 30.

## Model and Training

The model consists of:

- LSTM Layer
- Fully Connected Layer
- Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- Optimization Algorithm: Adam

Model is trained on 300 epochs.
