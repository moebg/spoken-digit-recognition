## Overview

Spoken Digit Recognition is an **isolated word recognition** system that transcribes individual spoken numbers from 0-9.

## Dataset

The [Free Spoken Digit Dataset (FSDD)](https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset) was used to train the model which had 1,500 recordings from 3 speakers with english accents.

The model was trained on 1,470 recordings, and tested on 30.

## Model and Training

The model consists of:

- LSTM Layer
- Fully Connected Layer
- Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- Optimization Algorithm: Adam

Model is trained on 300 epochs.

## Improvements and Features to Add

* The dataset needs more different types of speakers include women, and people with different accents in order for the system to work well in the world
* The model itself can be improved
* Use a better training/test strategy because the current model doesn't really perform as well as it should, it misses and gets right sometimes, nothing that should be used in production
* Have an interface to use your own voice to test out the model, make an easy front-end to interact with the model

Basically this was an experiment for me to see how to build a speech recognition system that only detects spoken digits, and so far it has a long way to go in terms of improving the performance.

## Usage

* `python spoke_digit.py` in order to run the program. It will train, and test the model on a test .wav file.

## Dependencies

* Numpy
* Librosa
* Tensorflow
* TFLearn
